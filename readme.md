Summer Data Contest
===================

This git contains the ongoing project for our entry for the summer data science challenge. 

It is a collaborative work between Iain Barr and Kyle Major.

About

The twitter handle @londonpostcodes is set up to recieve a tweet of a postcode and return the median house price in that area, along with a fact about that area. The data sources can be found in /Data/, an analysis of the datasources to break them down into tweetable facts can be found in /Analysis/BuildingFacts.ipynb and the python scipt that runs the service can be found in /Tools/replier.py
